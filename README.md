# Provebly Random Lottery Smart Contract üí∞

## About
This code is going to create a provebly random lottery smart contract!

## Functionalities üëª
1. Users can take part in the lottery by paying for the ticket
   1. The cumulative ticket fees of all participants will go to the winner of the lottery.
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
   1. And this will happen programatically.
3. The contract will be using Chainlink VRF & Automation
   1. Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
   2. Chainlink Automation -> Time based trigger for lottery draw

## Quickstart üöÄ
```
git clone https://github.com/alfheimrShiven/lottery-smart-contract.git
cd lottery-smart-contract
forge build
```

## Testing
`forge test`

or

`forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`

#### Test coverage
`forge coverage`

## Deploy
### On local ANVIL chain ‚õìÔ∏è
`make deploy`
### On Sepolia test net ‚õìÔ∏è
1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

1. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some testnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

2. Deploy

```
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

This will setup a ChainlinkVRF Subscription for you. If you already have one, update it in the `scripts/HelperConfig.s.sol` file. It will also automatically add your contract as a consumer.

3. Register a Chainlink Automation Upkeep

[You can follow the documentation if you get lost.](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts)

Go to [automation.chain.link](https://automation.chain.link/new) and register a new upkeep. Choose `Custom logic` as your trigger mechanism for automation.

4. Once **deployed** and **Upkeep registered** with Chainlink Automation, you can use EtherScan UI to interact with your lottery.
